notes.1=Version 0.8 of the ThreadVis (formerly ThreadArcs) extension contains several new features:\n\n- The visualisation can be displayed in a separate window.\n- A legend shows the names of all authors involved in a thread.\n- The size of the individual visualisation elements can be changed separately.
notes.2=HELP ME WRITE MY MASTER'S THESIS\n\nThe ThreadVis extension is part of my Master's Thesis. Additionally, an anonymised usage study is part of my work, for which I urgently need test persons. It's no effort and helps me a lot. For details, see my homepage (www.sbox.tugraz.at/home/x/xpert/threadvis/) at "How you can help".
notes.3=Don't worry, these messages will only be displayed once.\n\nCheers,\nSascha
